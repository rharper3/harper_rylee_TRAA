# Thames River Anglers Association

# I will be flipping a website, building it from basically nothing. Redoing the structure, the design, and the code. 

# Photoshop, Sublime Text, Adobe Illistrator, CSS, HTML, and JS will all be used in making this project happen.

# The website will be designed and coded by Rylee Harper
